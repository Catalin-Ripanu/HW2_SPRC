# HW2_SPRC

This project proposes the implementation of a REST API using *Docker* & *Docker Compose* technology, which allows isolating a program from the rest of the local system resources through a container. The implementation includes 3 microservices, namely: the *MySQL database*, the *server* that exposes the API, and the *phpMyAdmin* utility that manages the database through a graphical interface.
